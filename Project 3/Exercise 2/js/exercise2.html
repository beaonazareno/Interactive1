  	Create a Project 3 proposal that investigates an unseen process relating to data collection, management or presentation. Use the at least one reading & your own research to pose an interesting question, which your HTML-based Project 3 will seek to answer.

  	-data collection
  	-data management
  	-data presentatinon 

  	e.g instagram and their algorithms


<strong>Part 1, Reading Response<strong>
Whilst reading the article entitled "Bad Actors are Using Social Media as Designed" by WIRED, I was greatly intrigued by the statement which talks about the hopes of companies showing the world how thier algorithms operate. This made me think a lot about how I personally use social media today and the level of transparency that certain comapnies have to its customers and users in relation to others. There are some instances where a consumer can notice the truthfulness and trancparency that a company shows while there are other instances where one is unable to tell. One example that I can think of is one of my favourite clothing brands named Everlane that has an instagram story event every Tuesday of the week named "Transparency Tuesday" where they answer all questions in relation to their products including how their products are made as well as educating their followers and buyers on where and what materials they use and where they source these from.

In addition to this, I was also drawn to how this article talks about data management in the sense of how companies approach instances where users or people maliciously use their services or products.

<strong>Part 2, Potenital Question<strong>
What if Everlane created an visual experience for its consumers and customers, diplaying their transparency beyond their temporary "Transparency Tuesdays"?

How could the idea of transparency of companies be displayed

What if people could see the level of transparency in different companies (to educate the public, customers, consumers)

could be seen through a visual experience that educates 

<strong>Part 3, Solution Proposals<strong>
Proposal 1: I propose to create a typographic and illustrative experience to demonstrate and show Everlane customers where their products come from, what materials are used, as well as how they are created, packaged and shipped. This created the highest from of transparency to and from the company and their customers. Being able to know where the products you are buying has come from helps the companies gain the complete trust of their customers and potential buyers.

Proposal 2: I propose to create a single webpage that displays screenshots and images of different companies as well as what they display in their company values and principles versus the actual experience of customers and users. I think that this would be a great way to display the problem of transparency that occurs in different businesses and shows wether or not there are a lot of companies that are transparent with their customers. If this proposal were to be done, I would like for the image that is displayed every time the page is refreshed to be completely random and different.
